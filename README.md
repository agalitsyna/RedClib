# Red-C nextflow pipeline (DSL2 version)

## Introduction

Welcome to Red-C RNA-DNA interactome mapping with [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), DSL2 version.

Red-C is a method for genome-wide detection of RNA-DNA interactions in chromatin.
The details are in our [NAR paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa457) from 09 July, 2020:

Studying RNAâ€“DNA interactome by Red-C identifies noncoding RNAs associated with various chromatin 
types and reveals transcription dynamics.

The initial version of the pipeline (RedClib) was implemented in Python, and it was hard to scale. 
Next we switched to *nextflow* version of it, which was still lacking modularity and flexibility. 
Here we develop a DSL2 version of the pipeline that will be easy to adapt to custom user scenarios of RNA-DNA interactions. 

Disclaimer: DSL2 version is not complete yet!

## System requirements

1. You need a system supporting nextflow pipelines. For example, you can create conda environment with nextflow, 
   which will contain redc-nf dependencies:

```
conda env create -n redc-nf
conda activate redc-nf
conda install -c bioconda nextflow
bash ./bin/prepare_binaries.sh
```
   
2. Run test example:

```
nextflow run main.nf -profile test,conda,debug
```

This example should take up to 4 minutes. 
you may want to check that the results are the same as we provide in `output/` folder.
